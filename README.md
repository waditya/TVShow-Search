# TVShow-Search
Developed a TV show search Application using AngularJs, Node.js, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3. A user has to put search keyword in the search box. When the user clicks search button, The TV shows matching the search query are displayed as a result. When user clicks on details button all the details related to the show such as summary, cast and genre are displayed.  I have used TVMaze API. The JSON file is accessed and processed to extract details from it to display it to user.
